# This bot is no longer used. I am currently in development of a complete "rewrite" but also adapting the new "rewrite" library of discord.py.

# Again, I will repeat. This bot is outdated. It is here for personal historical reasons and not for actual use.

The reason why this repository is still available because it has some learning value out of it. But it's not meant to be used with the current state of discord or discord.py. Now stop asking me to help you set up a bot that's outdated.

The new bot is named "Koyomi Araragi" and here are some helpful links
